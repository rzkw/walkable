# Converting resource-constrained hardware into a web/dev server

turning an old laptop into an Ubuntu/Nginx server

---

## Why?

To stand out in the crowded junior dev market. Many other candidates will have built similar portfolio projects like I have - JavaScript to do lists, weather apps and similar HTML/CSS websites. I also want to demonstrate a willingness to wear multiple hats in professional environments, demonstrating an understanding of the infrastructure side of development.

## How?

The old laptop I had lying around had these specs:

- Model Name: Acer Swift
- Processor: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU N3450 @ 1.10GHz 1.10 GHz
- Installed RAM: 4.00 GB (3.84 GB usable, non-upgradeable)
- Storage: 58 GB SSD VID:90 HCG4a2
- Graphics Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics (128 MB)
- OS: Windows 10 Home Build 19045.5965, x64

I made sure to back up all existing files onto an external SSD before starting, followed by a clean install of Windows 10. I then generated a tutorial via Claude, with the following prompt:

> you are a software engineering tutor at a leading university. create a detailed step by step tutorial on converting an old windows 10 laptop into a dev server. include instructions on updating RAM module

After refining the prompt several times, I got it to the following [artifact](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/af8635e3-14e0-426a-bb4b-c7b11dec1efa) that includes the sticking points I needed:

- Resource/performance optimisation for my 4GB non-upgradeable RAM constraints
- Basic Linux and PowerShell to reflect real-world impact

I used the following scripts in Powershell as Administrator after necessary Windows Defender updates to remove apps that consume memory:

```
  Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Xbox*"} | Remove-AppxPackage
  Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Candy*"} | Remove-AppxPackage
  Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Photos*"} | Remove-AppxPackage
  Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Music*"} | Remove-AppxPackage
  Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Skype*"} | Remove-AppxPackage

```

I then disabled memory-intensive services:

```
  Get-Service "Superfetch" | Set-Service -StartupType Disabled
  Get-Service "Windows Search" | Set-Service -StartupType Disabled
  Get-Service "Fax" | Set-Service -StartupType Disabled

```

To optimise performance from Windows, I disabled hibernation, set power settings to High Performance mode, and prevented sleep when plugged in:

```
powercfg -h off
powercfg -s 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c
powercfg -change -standby-timeout-ac 0

```

To reduce RAM usage by the GUI:

- Start > type "this PC" > Right click "This PC" > Properties > Advanced system settings > Advanced tab
- Performance > Settings... > "Adjust for best performance" in the Visual Effects tab 

I also changed the page file size:

- Advanced tab > Virtual memory > Change...
- Custom size: Initial: 6144MB, Maximum 8192MB > Set > OK > OK

I installed [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install Linux on my RAM-constrained hardware without needing to run a virtual machine (VM). 

```
wsl --install

```
