# Converting resource-constrained hardware into a server

turning an old laptop into an Ubuntu server

---

## Why?

To stand out in the crowded junior dev/tech support market. Many other candidates will have built similar portfolio projects like I have - JavaScript to do lists, weather apps and similar HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites. I also want to demonstrate a willingness to wear multiple hats in professional environments, demonstrating an understanding of the infrastructure side of development.

## How?

The old laptop I had lying around had these specs:

- Model Name: Acer Swift
- Processor: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU N3450 @ 1.10GHz 1.10 GHz
- Installed RAM: 4.00 GB (3.84 GB usable, non-upgradeable)
- Storage: 58 GB SSD VID:90 HCG4a2
- Graphics Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics (128 MB)
- OS: Windows 10 Home Build 19045.5965, x64

I made sure to back up all existing files/data onto an external SSD before starting. I downloaded the latest version of [Ubuntu Server 25.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and installed [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to create a bootable USB flash drive with the server image. 

I used the Advanced startup settings in Windows to boot from EFI/USB, then pressed F12 during boot to install Ubuntu server. Choosing the correct SSID for my WLAN, I set a static IP (manual IPv4) in the Network Configuration step so that I can always connect to the server with the same address. I also installed OpenSSH server so I can remote into it from my Mac. 

The wizard then asked me to reboot to finish the setup.

After login, I used the following command to update and upgrade the packages that came with the install:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

That was pretty much it! It was a very straightforward process. Only issue I had was mistyping my WiFi password and having to use nano, the text editor, to change it within Netplan, Ubuntu's networking configuration tool.  

I looked for the configuration file:

```
ls /etc/netplan
```

...then opened it for editing:

```
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

I used `Ctrl+O` to write out the changes to the file, then `Enter` and `Ctrl+X` to exit. 

I'm keeping my server headless (without a GUI) to allow lots of practice with the terminal, also reducing the potential attack vectors and optimising performance due to the very limited RAM (4GB).

## Now what?

I set up remote login using SSH, a secure protocol that allows me to manage my server remotely (from the dinner table, or the cafe). To be detailed in another post!

## Learning Curve**:

Setting a static IP - I didn't use advanced router configuration as my router has its firmware restricted by my ISP. I chose an IP outside the given DHCP range but within the same existing subnet. 

I used [Google's](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) and [Cloudflare's DNS resolvers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/) to speed up browsing. 

## Conclusion

The Ubuntu wizard makes the process very easy, and it's a good distro for all the documentation, forum posts and community support you can find for it. Looking forward to loading my server with services, touching on automation and whatever else I can get it to do!
